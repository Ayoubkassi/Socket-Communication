-it's easer to manipulate people when u know them , how they function , what hey can do , what they can't do , when u know there limitations

-culture is not a big deal , or big idea , no that's wrong , we can get a problems , as judge people , and u don't understand them ,

-as Mohammed ramadan , example , he's singer and actor in same time , he says that , he's soft with singing more than acting , his prefered music is rap , american rap ,

-when we talk about africans , we usually use tripes , and they have some specila kind of music , non piano non guitar , so popular music , we talk of course about slaves , "we always find a way to communicate and find a solution when we are in common problem " , music was always was a way to express ur self , some times u're in a pain , so just by listening to a music , just like the lyrics has been writen for u

-those slaves is they allowed to use there musical instrument , to express what they feel


as a lot of region in morocco , every single place has some properties non like other

-same as animal , when u wanna buy an animal , as (moutton of aid) u check some places , so that u know it's a good target


-slaves , they are taken to USA , to do particular tasks , and of course without having there rights , so without instrument music , they can use there feets , to produce some kind of music , they start singing and working , those kind of music was so painful , and it give them so much power ,and positivity , and because of that , black people (slaves) tries to get a lot of money to erase pain inside them , so today black people do more than white , "always good idea" i can do more , i'm better than u i'm none just exist ...


-as people that use gold teeh , or change eyes as of animals ,

-but when u put historical events in front of u , u begin understand , why exists those reactions .

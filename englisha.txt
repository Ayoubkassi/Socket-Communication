- *Culture* is a set of patterns of human activity within a comuunity or social group and the symbolic structures that give significance to such activity , custom, laws, language, dress, architectural style, social standards, religious, beliefs, and traditions are all examples of cultural elements , this is all good , but it is best not to purpuse the question "what is culture?" but rather to ask about how we talk about culture and for what purposes .


-i have a great pleasure to be Moroccan , in Morocco when u cam into a shop u say "Hi" and then everyone else in the shop replies "hii" , u feel very much welcome , i was in France this summer , and i go into a shop , and then i said "hi" , after a moments people are wandering why he's saying hi , because they expecting me to start a conversation , to ask a question , they are more purposefull , they are much more pragmatic , and this is one of the first things u realize when u move into a different culture , it's not about greetings it's about how you do it and when you do it .


i was in the very remote region in Sichuan Province in China i was sitting in a bus in the morning when the bus started to drive it was pretty empty when I sat in but then suddenly people started to come in at one point it was full and a woman that was older than me came into the bus since I was born and raised in Moroccan culture my mom has always told me to leave my seat for women and so I stood up and I indicated she could set , and then she said no , and since I had been visiting in certain countries in Europe and learned that when a woman says no like this you should just sit down and silence look down , i did that but then something very special happened she looked at me she Smiled and then she sit On Me , and not only just sit on me , as u know in that part of china people do not have hear in there arms , so she was siting one me pulling my hear and laughting about it , with everyone else in the bus , as you can imagine  this did not feel very comfortable for me but it seems to be quite comfortable for her because she sat there for half an hour and everyone was laughing , so I started to laugh with them and finally  two families felt very comfortable and ended up inviting me for dinner that night when we arrive to the village and I ended up to stay over a couple of nights at one of the family because I've managed to put myself in a situation that wasn't comfortable for me  and become comfortable so the locals felt that they were much closer than me and this is what we are trying to do when we learn a new culture it is about learning to be comfortable in what is uncomfortable .
 
 
-we are all diffrent but the same , at the same time  ": it is good to be diffrent , this diversity is beautiful , if we do have just one thing , means there is no life , life is not just about one type of people , this cultural diffrences should been seen as strength and richness .
